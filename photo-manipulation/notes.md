# Photo manipulation

png.py -  python png reader and writer classes copied from Johann C. Rocholl

IMPORTANT: use 8 bit images, like gimp image mode indexed and put 256 colours in

so far only image.py work to read and write 8 bit ong images
with the use of the png.py file

build a program in python to adjust brightness and contrast,
add blur, detect edges for photos
so similar functions ot some basic photoshop functions
add more to transform file
