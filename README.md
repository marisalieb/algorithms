# Algorithms

1. binary search vs naive search
2. photo manipulation (with some functionality like basic photoshop)

the first project is a binary search comparison to naive search
you can find more info in the py file's notes and the notes.md file


and i am working on the photo manipulation project 
some functions like adjust brightness and contrast, add blur and maybe more 
similar functions of some basic photoshop functions
important here is use 8 bit images
because the image.py read and write function doesnt work properly otherwise

so far only the image file works, so more work is needed in the transform functionality
